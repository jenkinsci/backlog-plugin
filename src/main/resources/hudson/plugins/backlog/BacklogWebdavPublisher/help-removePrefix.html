<div>
    <p>First part of the file path that should not be created on the remote server.</p>
    
    <p>Directory structures are created relative to the base directory, which is usually the workspace.
    You normally do not want the full path to these files to be created on the server.
    For example if Source files were <code>target/deployment/images/**/</code> then you may want Remove prefix to be <code>target/deployment</code>.
    This would create the images folder under the remote directory, and not target/deployment.
    Jenkins environment variables can be used in this path.</p>
    
    <p><strong>If you use remove prefix, then ALL source file paths MUST start with the prefix.</strong></p>
